Early_Stage_Diabetes_Detection using Machine Learning

This repository will guide you in the prediction of early stage diabetes detection using various machine learning algorithms like KNN, K-Means, Random Forest, Naive bayes etc so using these algorithms we have trained and tested our dataset which is taken from Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) UCI which will predict the person is going having diabetes or not on early basis.
